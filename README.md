ncaa_scraper
============

This scraper pulls NCAA basketball play-by-play data from the NCAA official website and stores the results in an sqlite3 database.

To pull data from 2012-2013, simply run the script from the command line. Each game that has pbp data in the ncaa database will be saved in a sqlite3 database named play_by_play.db.
